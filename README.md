d3-draw
=======

A d3.js powered drawing application

d3-draw is work in progress but the idea is:

1. A 100% through the browser drawing application powered by d3.
2. Point and click drawing of shapes on a page.
3. Extensible (anyone can write modules or extensions to d3-draw).
4. Build drawings from data (d3 style).
5. Build data from drawings (extract meaning from shapes).

Similar tools:

* **visio** and omnigrafle can do much of the above but are not open source or browser based. 

More features:
* A powerful selection editor; after all selections are fundamental to d3 and
